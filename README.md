# PlantsVSZombies
A simple demo of  PVZ based on Java Swing.       
** Weihua He**
### Instruction
Based on Java Swing, this game demostrated a simple realization of PVZ, while the operation is just the same as PVZ. It realized simple animation of plants, zombies and Sun. What's more, the sound effect is based on JLayer.

### Important
- Make sure the Java is already installed;
- Unzip the UnzipMe.zip, which includes a runnable jar and Resource folder (with both audios and images);
- Keep the Resource folder (Be careful not to confuse it with the Resource folder in src or bin) and the runnable jar in the same path;
- Enjoy yourself!
     





#### Something More
Hey guys, I admit that the implementation codes for animation effects is stupid. But I just enjoy copying and pasting. So if there is anyone who wants to improve the realization, just take your time! :)
